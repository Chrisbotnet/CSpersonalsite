# CSsite
The Index will act as a home page for the website. 
Links at the top of the page go to the portfolio and about sections.
These links will be present on every page for easy navigation.

Encountered issue with images not displaying for others.
Images were being hosted on google photos so I opted to find a different way to add them.

Portfolio has a flex grid design and working links for projects and a mobile game.

At the bottom is the contact button which takes you to a form that will hopefully send an email to me once the form is completed.
This is not working currently but I will figure it out!
